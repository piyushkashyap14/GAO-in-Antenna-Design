GENETIC ALGORITHM OPTIMIZATION IN ANTENNA DESIGN

## Abstract
The design problem of imposing deeper nulls in the interference direction of uniform linear antenna arrays under the constraints of a reduced side lobe level (SLL) and a fixed first null beam width (FNBW) is modeled as a simple optimization problem. The real-coded genetic algorithm (RGA) is used to determine an optimal set of current excitation weights of the antenna elements and the optimum inter-element spacing that satisfies the design goal. Three design examples are presented to illustrate the use of the real-coded genetic algorithm (RGA) and the optimization goal in each example is easily achieved. The numerical results along with simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

With the help of above mentioned illustration and implementation, the importance of Genetic Algorithm (GA) Optimization is formulated and advocated in the world of Antenna Design.
